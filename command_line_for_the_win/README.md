<h1>Command line for the win</h1>

<h2>Background Context</h2>
<pre>
<a href='https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/a83_NOBEtXgFr1Yqej0HYA'>CMD CHALLENGE</a> is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. It’s a good training to improve your commandline skills!

<b>This project is NOT mandatory</b> at all. It is 100% optional. Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won’t get hurt if you don’t do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<li>A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory</li>
<li>This project will be manually reviewed.</li>
<li>As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green</li>
<li>Create a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels</li>
<li>Push this screenshot with the right name to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format</li>
</ul>

<h2>Specific</h2>
In addition to completing the project tasks and submitting the required screenshots to GitHub, you are also required to demonstrate 
the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move your local screenshots to the sandbox environment.

<b>Here are the steps to follow:</b>
<ul>
<li>Take the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.</li>
<li>Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.</li>
<li>Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the 
hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox environment.</li>
<li>Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.</li>
<li>Use the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.</li>
<li>Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.</li>
<li>Once the screenshots are transferred, you can proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.</li>
<li>Make sure to include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your project’s README.md file. 
This will help the reviewers</li> 
<li>understand how you performed the file transfer using SFTP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>NOTE :</h2>
The screenshoots of completed level should be inside the dir /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/

<h1>STEPS TAKEN TO COMPLETE FTSP TASK</H1>
<ol>
<li>I clicked on the terminal icon in the intranet.</li>
<li>Then clicked on FTSP option on the second top-lefr corner.</li>
<li>The second option allowed me to copy what I pasted in my debian terminal.</li>
<li>Then I was prompted to enter the password, which I copied again from the password option.</li>
<li>After pasting the password, the connection was established.</li>
<li>I then navigated to root by cd /root command.</li>
<li>Once inside the roon, I created a director by mkdir alx-system_engineering-devops </li>
<li>I then changed the directory by cd alx-system_engineering-devops </li>
<li>Inside the alx-system_engineering-devops, I created another director by mkdir command_line_for_the_win</li>
<li>I again changed the directory by cd command_line_for_the_win to be in teh desired directory.</li>
<li>Once in the desired directory, I started transfering the files as requested.</li>
<li>I transfered the file by calling "put 0-first_9_tasks.jpg" and called it again until all the required
files were transfered successfully.</li>
<li>To terminate the connection, I used the command "bye" and the connection was terminated.</li>
<li>I then went into the web terminal, navigated through /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
and used the "ls" command to check if the files were present. I confirmed that the files have been transfered successfully.</li>
</ol>
